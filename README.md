# React Portfolio

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm predeploy`
runs: `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm deploy`

Thid deploys the app to react pages using the repo path. (In my Case https://madimetjamadix.github.io/portfolio/ )

`Note:` update the homepage tag in the pakage.json file to https://[your-username].github.io/(your-repository)

# Editing
## `Content`
To update/change the content of the Portfolio, you have to update the `content.json` file in the `Data` folder. You'll put your own name, logoPath, tagLine, ... e.t.c. Make sure the pathnames to the images correspond to the names of the images.
## `Icons`
For Icons go to [Iconify](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/) and search for your desired icon names. Feel free to change the Icons' styles to your own liking.

## `Images`
- The main pictures like the `Logo`, `Background` and `animated-svg` reside in the `Images` folder in the `src` folder. If you change their names, make sure to update the code also.
- The projects Background images resides in the path: `public/assets/Images/`.
